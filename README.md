## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB & Cloudinary.
  
## Optimizations:
(optional)

Having more time I would continue creating a better User Experience and add rating for the shops. 

## Lessons Learned:

While working with FullStack and CRUD features. I learned how to use EJS and easy UI with Bootstrap.
